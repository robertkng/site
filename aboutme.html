  <p>
  I started to learn how to code because I've always wanted web applications since
  technology has made such a tremendous impact on our daily lives.
  I truly believe if you can imagine it, you can create it. I took
  the leap in 2016, and haven't looked back since.

    Interests
  </h2>

  <p>
  I love to travel! I love meeting people of all backgrounds and cultures. I love experiencing things that I can only dream of, that I can't do in the United States.<br>
  <br>
  I love playing sports. My friends and I get together on the weekends to play pick up basketball or football games in the park.<br>
