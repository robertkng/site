  I started to learn how to code because I've always wanted to create things on
  the web. I truly believe if you can imagine it, you can create it. I took

    Interests
  </h2>

  <p>
  I love to travel! I love meeting people of all backgrounds and cultures. I love experiencing things that I can only dream of, that I can't do in the United States.<br>
  <br>
  I love playing sports. My friends and I get together on the weekends to play pick up basketball or football games in the park.<br>
