  <h2>
  Why I code?
  </h2>
  <p>
  I started to learn how to code so I could build web applications that would make people's
  lives easier. Technology has made such a tremendous impact on our daily lives and I wanted
  to be part of it. I truly believe if you can imagine it, you can create it.

  Interests
  </h2>

  <p>
  <h5>Trading.</h5>
  When I am not coding, I am usually following the commodity markets. I am currently writing
  an ebook on commodity trading as I have been constantly asked how I became so successful
  trading.
  <br>
  <h5>Travelling.</h5>
  Another passion of mines is to travel. I love meeting people of all backgrounds and cultures.
  I love experiencing things that I can only dream of. Having visited 24 countries (and counting),
  I owe much of my success to staying humble, taking changes, and constantly learning.
