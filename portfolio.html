  A section for web dev projects -
  each project should have an image of the project,
  a short description about what it does and what
  technologies it uses, and a link to the actual project.
  Do this even if you only have one project or
  if you're not super ok with making this project publicly available -
  you'll constantly be updating this portfolio with
  new projects and tricks, so this will just serve as a backbone for later.
